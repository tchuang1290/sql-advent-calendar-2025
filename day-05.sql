-- Table Schema:
-- Table: elves
--   elf_id: INT
--   elf_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: vacations
--   elf_id: INT
--   start_date: DATE
--   return_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT
  elf_name,
  CASE WHEN return_date IS NULL THEN 'Still resting'
  ELSE CAST(return_date AS text) END AS return_date
FROM elves
  LEFT JOIN vacations
    ON elves.elf_id = vacations.elf_id
